The Complete PiSSTV is a compilation of programs designed which enables anyone to convert their Raspberry Pi Computer into an amateur SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmitter.

Originally a fork of the [SUWS/pisstv] project, which had the same purpose, however, has undergone significant changes that the only remanents are the original install script.
