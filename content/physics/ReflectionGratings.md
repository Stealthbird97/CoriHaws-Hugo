## Introduction
It has been noted by many that upon looking at CD in white light that at certain angles the reflected light is split up into its component colours and a rainbow is visible. This is an example of the phenomena of diffraction. The rainbow pattern is caused by the fact that light is "bent" by varying amounts depending on its wavelength. This diffraction pattern is somewhat complicated and would seem apparently useless and have little significance. This is very much the case when a non-directed white light source is used, however, this diffraction can be in fact very useful when a slit of directed light is used. Even more so when this light is monochromatic and coherent.

This report highlights how the principles of diffraction and the grating equation can be applied to determine properties of highly regular systems such as those in optical storage media, and how it can be used to measure the spacing of data tracks.
