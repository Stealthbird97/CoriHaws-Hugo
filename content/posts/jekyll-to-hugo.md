In all honesty, the reason I switched from jekyll was I was told to. Well, that is a bit of a lie.

I was simply told of an alternative by someone who is far more knowledgable than me in regards to website development and I decided to switch.

Given I had not become attached to jekyll in any way, mainly because moving to jekyll from a standard html template was purely for the sake of doing so rather out of necessity, I felt that I could do the same again.

After looking at Hugo, it is clear that the idea is essentially the same, after all both are static site generators, however it appears there is vastly more information and help to be found on the Hugo website than there is on the Jekyll website.
In the very least, the documentation is more clearly displayed and there is a greater number of examples for someone like me who does not wish to spend an exorbitant amount of time learning how to use the software to get something out of it.
